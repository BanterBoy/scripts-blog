Implementing the DLL
The implementation of the DLL is the easy part - just download or build the DLL, place it in system32 and add a registry key!

Note: These instructions need to be followed on all Domain Controllers in the domain if you wish to implement this for Active Directory, as any of them may end up servicing a password change request.

Download or build the DLL
The DLL itself needs to be placed in your system root directory (generally C:\Windows\System32).
The DLL name needs to be added to the multi-string “Notification Packages” registry subkey under HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA – note that you only need to add the name of the DLL, not including the file extension.
To ensure that the DLL works alongside your Group Policy password filtering settings,  ensure that the Passwords must meet complexity requirements policy setting is enabled through your relevant GPO(s).
Reboot the DC(s). Any password change request should now be filtered through the DLL.
